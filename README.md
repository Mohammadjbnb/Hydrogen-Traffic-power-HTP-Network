**Dataset for "A Hybrid Traffic Flow Forecasting and Risk-Averse Decision Strategy for Hydrogen-based Integrated Traffic and Power Networks"**
##Overview
This repository contains the datasets used in the research paper titled "A Hybrid Traffic Flow Forecasting and Risk-Averse Decision Strategy for Hydrogen-based Integrated Traffic and Power Networks." These datasets are crucial for understanding and replicating the test systems applied within the study.

##Description of Datasets
The datasets include various components of integrated hydrogen-traffic-power networks:

**Hydrogen Microgrids:** Includes data on three microgrids equipped with hydrogen charging stations, illustrating how hydrogen fuel can integrate into urban energy systems.
**14-Bus Power System:** Features two distributed generation (DG) units, which are essential for understanding power distribution and management within the integrated network. There are three stations included, providing essential data on the interaction between EVs and the power grid.
**Traffic Network:** Based on downtown Edmonton, this origin-destination traffic network comprises 18 nodes and 27 roads, offering insights into urban traffic flows.
